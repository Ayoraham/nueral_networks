# nueral_networks
This repository contains all my neural network projects.












Its purpose is to illustrate my gradual progression from a novice in deep learning to a more advanced learner and also motivate me to add new projects everyday.









I will try my best to make the projects as expressive and explanatory as possible for others who might be interested in learning
